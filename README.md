# Game Studies Journal Scraper - Annotated Source Code & Documentation Repository
Fully annotated Python Jupyter notebook of a data scraper used to mine and visualize information about (non-text) media published in contributions of the [Game Studies Journal (gamestudies.org)](https://gamestudies.org/) -- such as images, tables, hyperlinks, and iframes. 

Developed for, and as part of the contribution ***Other than Text: Media Used in Game Studies Publications. A Computational Analysis into 20 Years of Publications of the Game Studies Journal, and an Appeal for Research Through Design***, accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the [2023 DiGRA International Conference: Limits and Margins of Games](https://digra2023.org/). 

To view the software and its findings it is recommended to open either the `IPYNB` or `MD` source code versions on GitHub which contain an extended outline, documentation and code annotations as well as the generated data visualizations. 

This repository includes: 
  - the fully annotated source code together with data output in: 
    - Jupyter Notebook format (see `IPYNB` file in root folder), which can be viewed online, also downloaded and edited; 
    - Markdown format (`MD`) with compressed images, for online viewing with code highlighting, intended for archiving or conversions to other formats (see `MD archive version` folder); 
  - the 11 graphs generated using this software (see `data_export` folder);
  - a CSV file listing all images found in journal entries (see `data_export/CSV-GSJ image list.csv`); and 
  - a CVS file based on the previous, used by the author to manually classify all images by type (`data_import/CSV-GSJ image classification list.csv`). 
  
This repository is hosted temporarily by the author pending action by the [DiGRA board](http://www.digra.org/) for hosting and archiving contribution artifacts that cannot be accommodated within traditional paper formats. This is a test repository aiming to demonstrate a potential form of open, extendable, and forward compatible means for sharing non-standard research artifacts in videogame scholarship. This code is archived and citable at the handle [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/627804593.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/627804593)

The repository is provided with Copyleft GNU GPL license for anyone to share, modify, and extend this study.
