# Other-than-text (beta; test repository) 
Fully annotated Python Jupyter notebook, for a data scraper used to mine and visualize information about (non-text) media used in all contributions of the Game Studies Journal (images, tables, iframes, hyperlinks). 
The data produced were used for a contribution for the DiGRA 2023 conference, of which this source code is part of. 

To get an understanding of what this source code does and browse its findings, it's recommended to open the MD file on GitHub. 

This repository includes: 
  - the fully annotated source code in: 
    - Markdown (MD) format, which is easily readable with code highlighting online on GitHub; 
    - Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB) format, the native format it was developed, that can be downloaded and edited; 
    - PDF format, for basic viewing;
  - a CVS file used by the author to manually classify all images found in the inquiry. 
  
This is a test repository, to demonstrate a potential form of open, extendable, and forward compatible means for sharing research artifacts that cannot be accomodated by traditional contribution formats (i.e. PDFs). 

The repository is provided with GPLv3 lisence for anyone to share, modify, and extend.
